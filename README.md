# Horiseon-Refactoring

## Horiseon, Business Media Experts
I, James Lopez, was tasked with refactoring the code for this site. I was expected to understand the organization of semantics. Upon first glance I noticed the display of the website was aesthetically pleasing, neat and organized, but upon inspection of the HTML... one could see that this is not the case. The HTML was structured inappropriately, meaning elements were mostly non-semantic and riddled with redundant 'divs'. The problems solved in this project were as follow; to simplify non-semantic elements, elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, ensure img's contained alt attributes, a concise and descriptive title, and all of which in sequential order. Upon the submission of this task, I've learned one should always continue to improve and create a challenge in oneself to do so.
